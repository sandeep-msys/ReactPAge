This doesn’t technically block RSC’s release because you can also use routers for data fetching. Another change is that we’re also moving away from the file extension approach in favor of annotating boundaries.",

We’re looking at adding APIs to preload and load deduplicated external assets through React APIs that work in all React environments.",

This new architecture allows us to analyze and memoize more complex patterns such as the use of local mutations, and opens up many new compile-time optimization opportunities beyond just being on par with memoization hooks.",

While the goal of the playground is to make development of the compiler easier, we think that it will make it easier to try it out and build intuition for what the compiler does.

    p1: "The other option is to keep the component mounted and toggle the appearance visually using CSS. This preserves the state of your UI, but it comes at a performance cost, because React must keep rendering the hidden component and all of its children whenever it receives new updates.",
    p2: "Offscreen introduces a third option: hide the UI visually, but deprioritize its content. The idea is similar in spirit to the content-visibility CSS property: when content is hidden, it doesn’t need to stay in sync with the rest of the UI. React can defer the rendering work until the rest of the app is idle, or until the content becomes visible again.",
    p3: "Offscreen is a low level capability that unlocks high level features. Similar to React’s other concurrent features like startTransition, in most cases you won’t interact with the Offscreen API directly, but instead via an opinionated framework to implement patterns like:",

For each commit, it also shows all components that rendered and the amount of time it took for them to render. We also have a beta version of a Timeline Profiler introduced in React 18 that shows when components schedule updates and when React works on these updates. Both of these profilers help developers identify performance problems in their code.",
    p1: "We’ve realized that developers don’t find knowing about individual slow commits or components out of context that useful. It’s more useful to know about what actually causes the slow commits. And that developers want to be able to track specific interactions (eg a button click, an initial load, or a page navigation) to watch for performance regressions and to understand why an interaction was slow and how to fix it.",
    p2: "We previously tried to solve this issue by creating an Interaction Tracing API, but it had some fundamental design flaws that reduced the accuracy of tracking why an interaction was slow and sometimes resulted in interactions never ending. We ended up removing this API because of these issues.",

Synchronizing with Effects is the first published page in the series, and there are more to come in the following weeks. When we first started writing a detailed section about effects, we’ve realized that many common effect patterns can be simplified by adding a new primitive to React. We’ve shared some initial thoughts on that in the useEvent RFC. It is currently in early research, and we are still iterating on the idea. We appreciate the community’s comments on the RFC so far, as well as the feedback and contributions to the ongoing documentation rewrite.

    p2: "In JavaScript, arrays have a map() method that is commonly used for mapping data to other data, for example:",
    p3: "Using the map method, we can map our history of moves to React elements representing buttons on the screen, and display a list of buttons to “jump” to past moves.",
    p4: "Let’s map over the history in the Game’s render method:",

    p: "As we iterate through history array, step variable refers to the current history element value, and move refers to the current history element index. We are only interested in move here, hence step is not getting assigned to anything.",

We haven’t implemented the jumpTo() method yet. For now, we should see a list of the moves that have occurred in the game and a warning in the developer tools console that says:",

    h2: "Picking a Key",

    p1: "Imagine transitioning from",
    p2: "to",
    p3: "In addition to the updated counts, a human reading this would probably say that we swapped Alexa and Ben’s ordering and inserted Claudia between Alexa and Ben. However, React is a computer program and does not know what we intended. Because React cannot know our intentions, we need to specify a key property for each list item to differentiate each list item from its siblings. One option would be to use the strings alexa, ben, claudia. If we were displaying data from a database, Alexa, Ben, and Claudia’s database IDs could be used as keys.",
    p4: "When a list is re-rendered, React takes each list item’s key and searches the previous list’s items for a matching key. If the current list has a key that didn’t exist before, React creates a component. If the current list is missing a key that existed in the previous list, React destroys the previous component. If two keys match, the corresponding component is moved. Keys tell React about the identity of each component which allows React to maintain state between re-renders. If a component’s key changes, the component will be destroyed and re-created with a new state.",
    p5: "key is a special and reserved property in React (along with ref, a more advanced feature). When an element is created, React extracts the key property and stores the key directly on the returned element. Even though key may look like it belongs in props, key cannot be referenced using this.props.key. React automatically uses key to decide which components to update. A component cannot inquire about its key.",

  },
  {
    p: "If you don’t have an appropriate key, you may want to consider restructuring your data so that you do.",
    p1: "If no key is specified, React will present a warning and use the array index as a key by default. Using the array index as a key is problematic when trying to re-order a list’s items or inserting/removing list items. Explicitly passing key={i} silences the warning but has the same problems as array indices and is not recommended in most cases.",
    p2: "Keys do not need to be globally unique; they only need to be unique between components and their siblings.",
  },
  {
    h2: "Implementing Time Travel",
    p: "In the tic-tac-toe game’s history, each past move has a unique ID associated with it: it’s the sequential number of the move. The moves are never re-ordered, deleted, or inserted in the middle, so it’s safe to use the move index as a key.",
    p1: "In the Game component’s render method, we can add the key as <li key={move}> and React’s warning about keys should disappear:",
    p2: "Clicking any of the list item’s buttons throws an error because the jumpTo method is undefined. Before we implement jumpTo, we’ll add stepNumber to the Game component’s state to indicate which step we’re currently viewing.",
    p3: "First, add stepNumber: 0 to the initial state in Game’s constructor:",
    p4: "Next, we’ll define the jumpTo method in Game to update that stepNumber. We also set xIsNext to true if the number that we’re changing stepNumber to is even:",
    p5: "Notice in jumpTo method, we haven’t updated history property of the state. That is because state updates are merged or in more simple words React will update only the properties mentioned in setState method leaving the remaining state as is. For more info see the documentation.",
  },
  {
    p: "We will now make a few changes to the Game’s handleClick method which fires when you click on a square.",
    p1: "The stepNumber state we’ve added reflects the move displayed to the user now. After we make a new move, we need to update stepNumber by adding stepNumber: history.length as part of the this.setState argument. This ensures we don’t get stuck showing the same move after a new one has been made.",
    p2: "after a new one has been made.We will also replace reading this.state.history with this.state.history.slice(0, this.state.stepNumber + 1). This ensures that if we “go back in time” and then make a new move from that point, we throw away all the “future” history that would now be incorrect.",
    p3: "Finally, we will modify the Game component’s render method from always rendering the last move to rendering the currently selected move according to stepNumber:",
    p4: "If we click on any step in the game’s history, the tic-tac-toe board should immediately update to show what the board looked like after that step occurred.",
